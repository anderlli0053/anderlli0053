## Hi there 👋


- Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind

- Have more than you show, speak less than you know!

- Normality is a paved road; It's comfortable to walk, but no flowers grow on it!

- As above, so below, as within, so without, as the universe, so the soul.


🇦🇺         🇳🇿         🇸🇮         🇨🇦
